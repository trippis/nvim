# NVIM

This is an intended universal nvim config for cloning into any standard Windows, Mac or linux machine configuration i.e.under the ~/AppData/Local/nvim directory on Windows
or the ~/.config/nvim directory on Mac, Linux etc.

There is no need to create soft system links (or other hacks) on Windows to the ~/.config/init.vim file. Simply clone to the standard directory. The paths used in this configuration
should work on all standard neovim installations.
